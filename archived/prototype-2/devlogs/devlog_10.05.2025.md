## Prototype 2 â€” Dealership System Begins

---

### âœ… Progress Summary:
- Created the **Dealership scene** with working scene transitions
- Built and wired up **DealershipEntry.tscn**:
  - Displays car name, year, and a **Buy** button
  - Instanced dynamically into a scrollable list
- Successfully connected **Buy** button to `GarageData`:
  - Clicking it adds cars to the player's garage
  - Verified garage displays new cars immediately

---

### ðŸ§ª Debug Improvements:
- Removed automatic RX-7 spawn from the Main Menu
- Added a **Debug button** to manually spawn test cars
- Improved understanding of string formatting using `%s` and variables in `print()` statements

---

### ðŸ§  Learning Highlights:
- Gained a strong grasp of:
  - `for i in range(count)` loop structure
  - The role and behavior of **singletons (autoloads)** like `GarageData`
  - Godotâ€™s layout system (including `ScrollContainer`, `VBoxContainer`, and `MarginContainer`)
- Identified and investigated a persistent **UI layout issue** where dealership entries display correctly but appear in the top-left corner â€” to be resolved with fresh eyes in the next session

### ðŸ’¬ Reflections:
> "Iâ€™m amazed Iâ€™ve already made something. Clicking through the menus I built feels *real* â€” and imagining what playing the finished game might feel like is deeply motivating. Iâ€™ve started to see past the temporary high of starting something new, and instead look forward to the steady burn of shaping it into something playable."
