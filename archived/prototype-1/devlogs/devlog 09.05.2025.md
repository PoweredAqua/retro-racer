# Retro Racer Development Recap - Prototype 1 to 2 Transition
*Date: 2025-05-09*

---

## 🧠 Everything You’ve Learned and Implemented So Far

### 🔧 Technical Setup and Tools
- **Godot Engine:** Began building the game, including UI and car systems.
- **GitHub + GitHub Desktop:** Learned to clone, commit, push, manage branches, and archive work properly.
- **Version Control Best Practices:**
  - Finalized Prototype 1 in a dedicated branch
  - Created an `archived` branch structure
  - Started fresh for Prototype 2
  - Removed deprecated branches

---

### 🚗 Prototype 1: Accomplishments
- Built a **Garage UI** displaying hardcoded car entries.
- Solved UI layout issues.
- Created a theoretical framework for car storage and display.

**Result:** A functioning garage using static data — the first step completed.

---

### 📦 Transition to Prototype 2: Philosophy & Goals
- Each prototype will implement a single core mechanic.
- Goals for Prototype 2:
  - Load car data from a CSV
  - Implement a dealership rotation with a debug refresh button
  - Lay the groundwork for an in-game day system

**Path Forward:** Prototype until satisfied, then begin a pre-alpha build.

---

### 🧰 Version Control Structure
- `archived` branch holds folders for each completed prototype.
- `main` or named branches used for active development.
- Keeps repo clean, modular, and traceable.

---

### 📚 Conceptual Knowledge Built
- Modular development philosophy
- File management in GitHub Desktop
- Archival strategies with branches and file folders
- Confident navigation of Git + Godot integration

---

## 🌌 Brief Concept Recap

Originally inspired by retro racing games like **Gran Turismo 1 & 2**, the idea has evolved into:

- A **menu-based map hub** like GT4
- **Dealerships with rotating stock**, tied to in-game time
- A **Garage system** for car collection
- Long-term plans for **easter egg cars**, mastery unlocks, and more
- All grounded in a **data-driven**, scalable architecture

### 🏁 Status
Prototype 1: ✅ Archived  
Prototype 2: 🔄 In progress  
Next steps: Begin fresh with CSV integration and debug dealership refresh.
